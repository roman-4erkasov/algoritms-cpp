# algoritms-cpp
This code was written a long time ago, so I could significantly change my level of coding.

1. Simple file compressor with command line interface: prj01_huffman_file_compressing
2. Parser and calculator of complex arithmetic expressions: prj02_shutting_yard
3. Multiprocessing using STL: prj04_multithreading: dinning philosophers, producer-consumer
4. Different algorithmic solutions:
    - prj03_sorting_algorithms: Heap sort, Count sort, Quick sort, Radix sort
    - prj05_graphs: dijkstra shortest path, Bellman-Ford algorithm
    - prj06_interview_prep
