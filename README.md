# algoritms-cpp
This code was written a long time ago, so I could significantly change my level of coding.

1. prj01_huffman_file_compressing - simple file compressor with command line interface
2. prj02_shutting_yard - parser and calculator of complex arithmetic expressions
3. prj04_multithreading - Multiprocessing using STL: dinning philosophers, producer-consumer
4. Different algorithmic solutions:
    - prj03_sorting_algorithms: Heap sort, Count sort, Quick sort, Radix sort
    - prj05_graphs: dijkstra shortest path, Bellman-Ford algorithm
    - prj06_interview_prep
