# algoritms-cpp
This code was written a long time ago, so I could significantly change my level of coding.

1. Simple file compressor with CLI-interface: prj01_huffman_file_compressing
2. Parser and calculator of complex arithmetic expressions: prj02_shutting_yard
3. Multiprocessing using STL: prj04_multithreading
4. Different algorithmic solutions:
    - prj03_sorting_algorithms
    - prj05_graphs
    - prj06_interview_prep
